# 3(a) List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Python’s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## Program
```
items=[153,147,124,102]
sum_numbers=0
for x in items:
    sum_numbers += x
print(sum_numbers)
```
